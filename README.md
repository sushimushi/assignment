## My process

### Built with

- [react beautiful dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - For drag and drop

### What I learned

This was a frist time that i used drag and drop in my project. I feel more confidence in the used of drag & drop and using mirage for dummy objects. I am really enjoying how mirage helped my replicate the flow of data similar to live enviroment. Likewise, I feel the file structure allows for more reusable and manageable code.
